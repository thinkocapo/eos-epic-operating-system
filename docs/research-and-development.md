## DONE as of 07/09/2018
#### General...
1. Confirmed there is no official EOS Aidrop documentation. Just use the EOS API. Shell-script or javascript
2. Decided its better to run a shell-script as javascript is a middle man to the node. Some of the sample code I found is shell-script, some is javascript.

#### Running a Airdrop on Private net
1. Got a local node up and running, Wallet,Keys,Accounts, System BIOS Contract, deployed successfully, created a new Token, persisted.
2. Ran the airdrop (I did not include my full script in the repo yet).
3. Worked off of sample scripts that were used on a testnet, it was easy to comprehend. I read through the sample scripts used on PROD that give higher consideration to EOS Ram, Memory, Bandwith etc. I only found 3 such scripts, and only 2 were PROD usable. All are 'use at your own risk'.
4. Identified EOS RAM cost issue on Main net, see reddit r/eos r/eosdev they say its too expensive ($200,000 USD worth of EOS) to run a full airdrop.

#### Where to Run a EOS Node? Where to Run Airdrop on a EOS Node?
1. No need to run a Docker EOS Container self-hosted in AWS that runs 24/7...
2. Can run a local prod instance in a Docker Container that connects to main net
3. Connect to a EOS node as Saas (e.g. what Infura is to Ethereum) this is recommended. You can connect/airdrop to a node someone else is running.

#### Snapshot
1. I have the genesis snapshot of accounts. I still need to perform due diligence and make sure these exist on the main net and have a EOS balance.
2. There is no tutorial or how-to on generating your own snapshot, it was generated by an organization and provided online for free.

#### Airdrop script(s)
`airdrop-test.sh`

#### Price of RAM as of August 5th, 2018
- https://coinlib.io/coin/EOSRAM/EOS+RAM says RAM is $0.80 / Kib
- https://www.eosrp.io/ says RAM is $1.509 / Kib  
- [this link](https://steemit.com/eos/@leordev/eos-ram-and-bandwith-analysis-airdropping-steps-on-junglenet) says its 37,540 kb for all 163,930 genesis accounts, so multiplied by today's prices its $30,000 - $56,000
overall, price has dropped significantly from 1 month ago, if you look at any graphs of the EOS RAM price

## To-Do
#### Where to Run a EOS Node? Where to Run Airdrop on a EOS Node?
1. ~~Running a airdrop is thousands of scripted RPC calls to the EOS node, so connect to our own Docker EOS self-hosted, or are Saas EOS Nodes okay with this? Perhaps they aren't cool with such high traffic.~~ as long as your have the system resources to pay for it, and test on testnet first
#### General
1. Comprehend every line of code in the sample scripts. ~~Comprehend what CPU, Bandwith, RAM are for~~
2. Use [cleos system](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cleos/v1.1.0/reference#cleos-system-regproxy) to stake eos for CPU, Bandwidth and reserve RAM, TRY IT on testnet - Need use EOS to get all 3? split between the 3? docs on how 'cleos system' works 
3. Perform airdrop on the eos test nets for EOS Dawn v4.0.0: Jungle Testnet, Arrowhead, Trinity test nets
4. Try staking and reserving on main net using my own personal EOS
5. Prove via [EOS NY Calculator](https://www.eosrp.io/#calc) what it will cost

#### Snapshot
1. ~~Snapshot is based on a set of blocks in the EOS blockchain, so maybe I can iterate through the transactions lists (or state trees) in every block and compose a list of all addresses used (and then confirm which ones have balance). It would be a map-reduce job. This way we could define our own range of blocks (i.e. snapshot since MM/DD/YYYY that we define).~~
2. [Snapshots As A Service: Airdrops for All www.EOSSnapshots.io](https://medium.com/eos-new-york/snapshots-as-a-service-airdrops-for-all-2bd51548b1ac)
3. "X% of the tokens will be allocated to the team" is the team represented by 1 address or will there be multiple (i.e. split)?
