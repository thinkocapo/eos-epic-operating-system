## DONE as of 07/09/2018
#### General...
1. Confirmed there is no official EOS Aidrop documentation. Just use the EOS API. Shell-script or javascript
2. Decided its better to run a shell-script as javascript is a middle man to the node. Some of the sample code I found is shell-script, some is javascript.

#### Running a Airdrop on Private net
1. Got a local node up and running, Wallet,Keys,Accounts, System BIOS Contract, deployed successfully, created a new Token, persisted.
2. Ran the airdrop (I did not include my full script in the repo yet).
3. Worked off of sample scripts that were used on a testnet, it was easy to comprehend. I read through the sample scripts used on PROD that give higher consideration to EOS Ram, Memory, Bandwith etc. I only found 3 such scripts, and only 2 were PROD usable. All are 'use at your own risk'.
4. Identified EOS RAM cost issue on Main net, see reddit r/eos r/eosdev they say its too expensive ($200,000 USD worth of EOS) to run a full airdrop.

#### Where to Run a EOS Node? Where to Run Airdrop on a EOS Node?
1. No need to run a Docker EOS Container self-hosted in AWS that runs 24/7...
2. Can run a local prod instance in a Docker Container that connects to main net
3. Connect to a EOS node as Saas (e.g. what Infura is to Ethereum) this is recommended. You can connect/airdrop to a node someone else is running.

#### Snapshot
1. I have the genesis snapshot of accounts. I still need to perform due diligence and make sure these exist on the main net and have a EOS balance.
2. There is no tutorial or how-to on generating your own snapshot, it was generated by an organization and provided online for free.

#### Airdrop script
`airdrop-test.sh`

## To-Do
#### Where to Run a EOS Node? Where to Run Airdrop on a EOS Node?
1. Running a airdrop is thousands of scripted RPC calls to the EOS node, so connect to our own Docker EOS self-hosted, or are Saas EOS Nodes okay with this? Perhaps they aren't cool with such high traffic.
2. Run on the eos test net EOS Dawn v4.0.0 Jungle Testnet, Arrowhead, Trinity test nets
3. Comprehend every line of code in the sample scripts.
4. Understand EOS Ram, Memory, Bandwith, Stak'ing.
5. Stay up to date on the issue with EOS RAM costing too mcuh right now, see reddit r/eos r/eosdev

#### Snapshot
1. Snapshot is based on a set of blocks in the EOS blockchain, so maybe I can iterate through the transactions lists (or state trees) in every block and compose a list of all addresses used (and then confirm which ones have balance). It would be a map-reduce job. This way we could define our own range of blocks (i.e. snapshot since MM/DD/YYYY that we define).
2. "X% of the tokens will be allocated to the team" is the team represented by 1 address or will there be multiple (i.e. split)?
